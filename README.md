## Project Description

Customer churn prediction uses historical and real-time customer data to classify whether a customer is likely to leave a service or continue. This project utilizes classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The dataset is processed, analyzed, and used to train and evaluate the models, followed by predictions on unseen data.
